# End-to-End Web3 dApps:
## certificate generation, distribution, and value transfer with Algorand NFTs and smart contracts 
**Business Need**

Web3 technology is inherently about the user controlled internet. It is being achieved by a growing stack of decentralized technologies, such as blockchains, smart contracts, oracles, crypto wallets, storage networks, and more.   

In this project, the client is 10 Academy; the client would like to solve the challenge of ensuring that certificates are available to all trainees in a secure way, and (if possible) that certificate holders can benefit from smart contract actions now and in the future.  At present, certificates are distributed as simple PDF files, without the ability to verify their authenticity nor can 10 Academy undertake smart actions with the trainees/their contracts.

10 Academy has partnered with Algorand to use the Algorand Blockchain as the foundational element of the NFT, and this must now be implemented.  In this project you will build end-to-end Web3 dapps on the Algorand Blockchain that will help 10 Academy generate and distribute Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as certificates that will represent the successful completion of a weekly challenge to trainees, and allow trainees with NFTs to interact with a smart contract to perform pre-defined actions.

### Project structure
You will find two implementations of algorand transactions and NFT creation in this project:

1. Using JS SDK and
2. Using python SDK

You wil find a designated folders for each implementation. Moreover, a react app is on development for facilitating the buisness requirements.

The frontend react app is integrated with *MyAlgoWallet* which will be used as a login method for trainess.
